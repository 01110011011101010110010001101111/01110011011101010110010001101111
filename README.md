### Welcome to my GitHub! 

#### Mini Intro

Hello there! Here you'll find my trove of projects! 
I would say that I'm currently still in my exploration phase, and I've been trying to explore all types of CS, from robotics to security to hardware. 

#### Projects

My current major open-source project is maintaining [torchquantum](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum)â€”feel free to reach out with any questions about the library! I also work on several other projects which aren't open-source (yet!)

##### Custom-Made Tools I Regularly Use

- [jankterm](https://github.com/01110011011101010110010001101111/jankterm) -- my little terminal emulator! it's not 100% ready yet but i enjoy the custom keybindings and messing with it
- [recovercli](https://github.com/01110011011101010110010001101111/recovercli) -- a little cli to help me with retrieving recovery codes
