### Welcome to my GitHub! 

#### Mini Intro

Hello there! Around there, I go by `sudo` (which is `01110011011101010110010001101111` in binary!) Here you'll find my trove of projects! 

I'm still exploring my interests, but I find particular joy in high-performance computing and low-level programming!

> **I am currently in the job market, seeking full-time positions in software engineering. If you think I could be a good fit, please [reach out](#contact)!**

#### Projects

My most recent open-source project is maintaining [torchquantum](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum)â€”feel free to reach out with any questions about the library! I also work on several other projects which aren't open-source (yet!) Check out below for a snapshot of some open-source projects I'm particularly proud of!

##### Custom-Made Tools I Regularly Use

Someday I'd like all my tools to be custom-made! For now though, here's my growing list of custom-built tools I regularly use!
